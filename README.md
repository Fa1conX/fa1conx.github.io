random projects, and stuff I am working on/have worked on in the past

## QR code generator

designed just to be a simple QR code generator that uses <a href="https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs">qrcodejs</a> to do the actual backend work. 
Should be pretty simple, and I might add in other features as I need them.

### TODO
- create a nice index.html home page with links to repos and projects
- remove old stuff and clean up folders etc.
- create pages for different projects I am working on.
